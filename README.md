# ðŸš§ WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš§

This branch is currently just a playground for me while trying out Rust. The plan is to rewrite the backend of Speer in Rust to make it faster and more efficient (this is important because I only have a cheap and slow server). Also I would really like to learn web development in Rust so this seemed like a logical solution for that. 

Suggestions are welcomed, but please keep in mind that this is an **experiment** and as such the code is most likely ugly and wrong.

If you are looking for the **actual source code of Speer** look at the **'main'** branch of this repository.
